# NFL Player Weight Analysis Repository

This GitHub repository is dedicated to investigating whether the average weight of NFL players has changed from 1999 to 2015. As a hypothetical NFL scout, you have identified a player with exceptional skills but are concerned about their weight relative to the standards in the NFL in 2015. This repository will help you evaluate if your player's weight of 226 lbs is suitable for the NFL in 2015, given the assumption of no weight gain.

The analysis will encompass statistical tests, data visualization, and detailed reporting.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is "nfl_weight_2015_1999.csv," which is sourced from NFLSavant.com. This dataset contains information about NFL player weights for the years 1999 and 2015.

## Analysis Process

The analysis in this repository will be divided into two main parts:

A. **Comparing Average Weights (1999 vs. 2015):**
   - We will start by selecting samples of NFL players from the years 1999 and 2015.
   - The primary objective is to determine if there has been a significant change in the average weight of NFL players between these two different years.

B. **Evaluating Player Weight (2015):**
   - A specific player in question weighs 226 lbs and aims to play in the NFL in 2015.
   - We will conduct hypothesis testing to assess whether the player's weight of 226 lbs is considered too light for the NFL in 2015.
   - The hypothesis will claim that the mean weight of NFL players in 2015 is greater than 226 lbs.


Please note that this README.md file provides an overview of the analysis process, and the detailed analysis and findings can be found in the code file. The final results, including findings and conclusions, will be compiled into a comprehensive report.
